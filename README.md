# Pitch-color Synesthesia in D3
I created this block to visualize various [pitch-color scales](http://rhythmiclight.com/archives/ideas/colorscales.html) proposed over time. Hover your mouse cursor over the squares corresponding to each pitch to hear it in MIDI! Audio code from [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js).
